# Learning Objective 2: Process Integration

## Introduction
The Lab will cover how to map an integrations to a Milesone

Estimated Lab Time: 10 minutes

More info on Insight Models can be found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/integration-cloud/user-int-insight-oci/work-models-integration-insight.html).

## Learning Objectives
In this lab, you will learn how to create the following:
- Map an Intergration to a Milestone
- Modify your Draft into a Configured state
- Acivate your Insight Model

Mapping milestones involves identifying execution points that best represent when a milestone has been passed. 
As part of the mapping process, you must also define extraction criteria for the unique instance identifier and indicators (dimensions and measures). Extraction criteria define the rules to extract information from runtime messages, and is expressed using XPath expressions. Before you can activate a model, the extraction criteria must be defined. 
### Map a Milestone
    A. 
        1. 
        2. 
            a. 
        3. 

Once Integration has been mapped to the Milestone, it's time to change the Draft Model into a Configured State <br />
### Configured State

    A. 
    B. 

Activating a Model allows it to be tested or used. Active models showcase status of a green dot that says "Activated". <br />
### Activate Model

    A.  C
        1. 
        2. 
        3. Click <Save> on the upper right corner

When a business process implementation spans more than one integration or process, or both, you must assign the model's unique instance identifier to mapped milestones to establish the correlation between the actions in the same instance of the business process and extract the unique instance identifier value when the specified milestone is passed. <br />

Now your turn to try!

## Excercise 2
 You will map several Milestones to an existing integration, you will move your draft into a configured state and then active state. 

### Task 1: Map Milestones

     
### Task 2: Draft to Configured State

    
### Task 3: Configured State to Active State


## Solution



## Summary
Great job creating your Draft Model.<br />
